<p>They have finally gone and done it. The robots have taken over. At least when it comes to video games. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;arstechnica.com&#47;" target="_blank">Ars Technica<&#47;a>&nbsp;has an article about a project presented at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sigbovik.org&#47;" target="_blank">SigBovik 2013<&#47;a>&nbsp;by Tom Murphy. He's basically created a program that can play Super Mario Bros pretty successfully as well as other classic side-scrollers.</p>
