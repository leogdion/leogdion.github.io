  target=\"_blank\">web site</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;my friend Theresa and it has been
  launched. The web site is dedicated \"to serve the needs of women who have left
  the convent.\" It took a team of us but we have created a site which is very visually&nbsp;appealing.

<p>As the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.leonieslonging.org&#47;#!&#47;?page_id=9" target="_blank">web site</a> states, there is a major need out there:</p>
<blockquote><p>When a woman leaves the convent, she typically only has the clothes on her back and a few personal items.&nbsp; Quite often she goes home and stays with family or friends while she discerns her next steps.&nbsp; The first needs are physical &ndash; clothes, food, housing, transportation, etc.&nbsp; After these are met, she has emotional and spiritual needs.&nbsp; For example: Can she get a ride to Mass?&nbsp; Can she find a spiritual director?&nbsp; Does she need a good counselor?</blockquote><br />
