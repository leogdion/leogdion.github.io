<blockquote><span style="color: #252525;">&nbsp;I still think nothing that has been suggested in the last 10 minutes beats "smashy smashy egg men".<&#47;span><&#47;blockquote><br />
I remember some years watching Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and&nbsp;<a class="fl" style="color: #1a0dab;" href="https:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;search?espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=705&amp;q=edgar+wright&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAGOovnz8BQMDgwEHnxCnfq6-gVFJfIaxEphpUmJSmKIllp1spZ-WmZMLJqxSMotSk0vyi5am7nKxsba9rH9T11rodldRjLS6FQBe3ihkTQAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ThO5U43wDNGVyAS3toDACQ&amp;ved=0CMsBEJsTKAIwFg">Edgar Wright<&#47;a>'s&nbsp;first big hit with Shaun of the Dead. I really wanted to laugh and laugh hard at it but it was difficult. This wasn't your typical comedy or your typical horror&#47;sci-fi movie. At points it tried to make you feel&nbsp;emotions that were not typical for a movie of those genres and then a few minutes later your emotions were shifted in a completely different directions. This was not something I was use to. The World's End does that as well yet for some reason I enjoyed it.</p>
<p>The World's End, the third film in the&nbsp;<i>Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy<&#47;i> is precisely about that the end of the world&nbsp;but also the pub in the fictional english town of&nbsp;<span style="color: #252525;">Newton Haven. The main character Gary King (Simon Pegg) is trapped in his teens, specifically the early 1990s and despite being a middle-aged alcoholic is intent on recapturing those moments&nbsp;by completing his quest for the Golden Mile along with his mates from those glory days. The Golden Mile is the ultimate Newton Haven pub crawl consisting the town's 12 pubs.<&#47;span></p>
<p>In this writing and directing team's classic style, it makes great commentary on being trapped&nbsp;by the hopes of the past, alcoholism, conformity, and my new favorite term "<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.urbandictionary.com&#47;define.php?term=starbucking&amp;defid=7137488" target="_blank">Starbucking<&#47;a>". The dialog is crisp and the twists and turns are done well and with great comedic timing.</p>
<p>Why did I like this movie better and then Shaun of the Dead? I&nbsp;do think I may be partially to blame for that but Simon Pegg's Gary King is such a pathetic loser. All his high school friends have essentially made something of themselves whereas Gary thinks of high school as his high point. He is willing to do whatever it takes to complete this bar crawl with his old friends whatever - lie about his mother's death, put his friends' lives at risk - whatever.</p>
<p>The opening scene does a great job hilariously illustrating&nbsp;Gary's pathetic alcoholism. Pierce Bronson&nbsp;is pretty funny as the former school teacher while Martin Freeman plays a more or less toned down straight man compared to his Dr.Watson. As is typical in these films, there is a genre theme to this film, in this case sci-fi, however it is revealed well into the film. The mood change in the movie is dramatic in a sense but the characters remain essentially who they are and if they don't you'll know why (wink, wink).</p>
<p>The World's End is a hilarious example of what the Cornetto team can do and if it is their final film in the so-called "Trilogy" then it is a good one. I highly recommend this film for those who stomach the quirky humor and strange science fiction aspect.</p>
