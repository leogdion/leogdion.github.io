<p>I don't know what to write about. I actually would rather not write right now. I'd rather have someone make me laugh and to learn something. That would be so much easier. Writing about stuff (tm), I so difficult for two primary reasons. I have to think and I have to put myself out there.<&#47;p>
<p>I hate having to think about what I want to write about. It is such a pain in the butt. I mean it is better in middle of writing when you have momentum going but the inertia is so strong not to write. For me it is like running, I use to hate to run. Getting my butt off the couch&#47;chair&#47;sofa initially is a difficult task. However once I get some fresh air and get going I don't want to stop. Yes there are occasional times when running hurts and I have decipher whether the pain is good pain making me stronger or bad pain making me weaker; but for the most part once the habit is formed the momentum keeps going. There are the occasional real distractions (a little one needs me) and dumb distractions (a wikipedia hole of unimportant questions and facts); but for the most part once I get going I keep moving.<&#47;p>
<p>The other challenge is dealing with the embarrasement of putting myself out there. There's the embaressment of saying something dumbly and saying something dumbly. What if I post something I regrett or I say something which is interpertted the wrong way. Yes that scares me, but the alternative might be as scary. Not practicing my writing skills, not communicating except in the occasionly link share on a social network is not sufficent for me and what I do. We live in the internet age and blog post may be a decent and fullfilling way to communicate and broadcast information to others. Secondly theres the old fashioned spelling and grammar mistakes. I WILL MAKE THESE NO MATTER WHAT. It is through practice and constructive critisism from other that I will learn to be a better writer and blogger.<&#47;p>
<p>There now I can conclude talking about my challenges writing a blog post whether it is fear or intertia. I hope this can help you understand how to overcome those challenges.<&#47;p></p>
